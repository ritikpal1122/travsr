// ── #588: what the travsr-lang release matrix actually ships ──────────────────
//
// The CLI used to build `<binary>-<target>` for whatever `current_target()`
// returned and hand it straight to the downloader. Windows was added to
// `current_target()` without a matching release leg, so `travsr lang install`
// asked for an asset that had never been published and every language ended in
// a raw 404 — a setup flow offered to users that could not succeed.
//
// Two separate questions, deliberately kept apart:
//
//   1. What is the asset for this target *called*?     `wrapper_asset_name`
//   2. Does a published release actually *contain* it? `wrapper_available`
//
// Conflating them is what produced the bug: `current_target()` returning a
// triple was read as proof a build existed for it, so a naming rule silently
// doubled as a capability claim. Kept apart, the `.exe` rule can be correct and
// fully tested for a platform no release ships yet, while the installer still
// refuses to ask for it.
//
// (2) is the contract with `.github/workflows/release.yml` in
// Travsr-com/travsr-lang, and the `wrapper_release_drift` test below checks it
// against the live release inventory (in the lang-release-drift workflow) so
// the two cannot drift apart silently again.

/// Target triples a *published* travsr-lang release contains wrappers for.
///
/// Not the same as the targets the release workflow can build: a target belongs
/// here only once a tag has actually shipped it. Travsr-com/travsr-lang#15 adds
/// the `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` leg, so Windows joins this list in the commit
/// after the first tag containing those assets, and `wrapper_release_drift` is
/// what proves the claim rather than a reviewer taking it on faith.
///
/// Until then Windows takes the honest path from #588: `lang list`, `lang
/// detect` and `init` report "not available on x86_64-pc-windows-msvc yet"
/// rather than offering an install that 404s.

// ── #410 M1: in-process archive extraction ────────────────────────────────────
//
// The download paths used to shell out to `tar -xzf` and `unzip -qo`. Two
// problems with that, beyond the obvious dependency on those binaries existing:
//
//  1. A release asset carrying `../` entries could write outside the
//     destination (zip-slip / tar traversal), and whether it did depended on
//     which implementation the host shipped — GNU tar, bsdtar and busybox all
//     differ, so the safety of an install varied by machine.
//  2. `unzip` is simply absent on many systems, failing the install with an
//     error that says nothing useful.
//
// Extracting in-process fixes both, and makes the traversal check something
// this repo owns and can test rather than something it inherits.

/// Largest archive accepted for extraction.
///
/// The binary download paths already cap at 100 MB (`SIZE_LIMIT`) and 200 MB
/// (`SCIP_SIZE_LIMIT`); the archive paths had no cap at all and buffered the
/// whole response in memory. This matches the larger of the two, since share
