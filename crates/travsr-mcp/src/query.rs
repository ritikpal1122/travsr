//! Shared CLI query execution (#318 O1).
//!
//! `travsr ask` / `travsr graph` / `travsr status` produce their data through
//! the functions in this module, on two routes:
//!
//! 1. **Daemon route** — the daemon's control socket receives a
//!    `ControlMessage::Query`, runs these functions against its warm store,
//!    and ships the payload back as JSON. No per-command store open.
//! 2. **Direct route** — no daemon running: the CLI opens the store
//!    (read-only fast path) and calls the same functions in-process.
//!
//! Because both routes execute identical code, CLI output is byte-identical
//! regardless of routing. The serialized payload shapes are versioned by
//! `travsr_ipc::QUERY_PROTOCOL_VERSION` — bump it on any breaking change here.
