// reach the cross-encoder. `search_nodes_by_name`'s rank is dominated by name-match
// POSITION (exact > `:suffix` > prefix > substring), with kind only a minor
// tiebreaker WITHIN a band — so a field-only/container node (`struct:Daemon`, fields
// only) outranks the logic-bearing definition of the same symbol (`impl:Daemon`,
// `Daemon::run`) whenever the struct's signature is the closer literal match, and the
// reranker then judges the bare struct, not the code that answers the query.
//
// #463 reorders a SMALL name-match head so a body-bearing definition is preferred
// before the bounded emit, WITHOUT widening the pool to path-substring collisions.
